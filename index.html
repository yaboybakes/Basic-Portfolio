I'm curious enough to find out that reason. I make mistakes. I'm creative. I'm optimistic. I procrastinate. I keep my word. I value honesty. Integrity. I don't mind hard work as long as everyone is working hard.  I tip my hat off to whose who tried even when they weren't guaranteed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success. <br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated the University of Texas at Austin with a Computer Science degree . That doesn't mean I know everything about computers and yes, before you ask I am definitely as stumped as you on why the printer won't work but I feel blessed having a skillset that can impact others in a positive way. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One late summer night I was driving down The Drag and realized that most of these buildings have been here for +/- 100 years. The physical world (pworld for short) does not change that fast in comparison to the digital world. Everything is already claimed in the pworld by someone whether that person is fom the government, a business or private owner. In order to change anything in the pworld it requires vast resources already controlled by someone else. Construction alone takes months or years just to build a single house let alone an entire commerical building. Permits are bought, revoked and paid for again just to grant permission from some entity that &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes , I am allowed to do this". Who grants that entity authority? <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the digital world there are no permits needed to build. The only resources required are my own time, the cost of hardware/electricity and if I really wanted 24/7 access,the internet. Nowadays even the internet is treated as a universal resource in most modern countries. Given enough experience, I could theoretically "code Rome in a day" without need of land, permit or material resources that <strong>inhibit</strong> almost all projects that would make the world we live in a better, sustainable place for us AND future generations. There is no better time to start than now. #justsaying </p>
